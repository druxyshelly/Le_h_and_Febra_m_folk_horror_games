        <h3 class="lb_heading">Paper Bride 2: Zangling Village</h3>
        <p class="lb_text">
            Midsummer’s bride dressed in a gown of paper;
            <br>
            Torn from her groom and lost forever.
            <br>
            July, fifteen, marry the bride,
            <br>
            Relatives and friends cry at the scene
            <br>
            Paper for making wedding dresses blowing in the wind
            <br>
            When will I see my beloved again?
            <br><br>
            In part one, we heard about Zangling Village, a strange land with many outdated customs. Although the story of Nie Moqi and Ning Zifu has a happy ending, with the evil being properly punished, the good people live happily. But Zangling Village still exists a series of mysteries with customs that destroy the happiness of many families.
            <br><br>
            Now let us open the curtains of the past in Zangling Village.
            <br><br>
            The story in Paper Bride 2 is completely independent from the first part. You will be transformed into the character Dao Mong Yen. She has always had strange, haunting dreams about a young woman in a wedding dress being hung on the altar. It seems that Zangling Village not only has the custom of sacrificing children, but they also have a strange custom of marrying young girls to Luc Tang Bodhisattva as a wife. And even more terrifying when the bride's face in the dream is Dao Mong Yen. A lament filled rhyme resounded, and suddenly Dao Mong Yen was tied in the place of the bride. In front of her were life-like dolls. A man called Dai Vu Hien is at the head wearing a red robe, holding a ringing bronze bell. A wooden doll holding a large knife appeared in front of Mong Yen, and the doll's head fell abruptly — that is when she woke up.
            <br><br>
            It was this strange dream that prompted Dao Mong Yen to return to Zangling Village to find the answer to the nightmare that had pursued her for the past five months. What does the dream signify? Is this her past life story? How will Mong Yen solve the original mysteries that surround Zangling Village?
