                <p>Two identical twin daughters, Mac Le and Mac Ky, of the Nie family who reside in the Trang Linh village, were born on a sound day. A photograph of a family of four that was hidden in Mac Ky's old home and inscribed with the words "Ancestor spirits bless Mac Le, Mac Ky" shows that they adored both of their sisters when they were little. Mr. and Mrs. Nie adored their children and grandkids, but the villagers pressed them to have them arrested because the sisters Mac Le and Mac Ky were born on a pure lunar day and were allegedly inscribed with the Luc Tang Bodhisattva. The locals were led by Dai Vu Hien. </p>
                <p>One of them had to be given up by Nie and his wife. Each child was born with a broken gut, so at first the parents did not agree to adopt. However, the two sisters Mac Le and Mac Ky kept growing unwell, and Dai Vu Hien would continually whisper. At the last end, with superstition in their ears, Mac Le plays the role of the abandoned child in order to save his sister's life. </p>

                <p>Her younger sister Mac Ky took over as the only daughter of the Nie family after her sibling was abandoned. Mac Ky was raised by his parents and had a pretty calm childhood with his friend Tieu nearby. </p>
                <p> Nevertheless, after Tieu moved to the city to live, Mac Ky and the boy with the last name of Tieu also lost touch. The identical journals show that many lads in Trang Linh hamlet fell in love with Mac Ky as she grew older and more attractive. Her sweet and upbeat demeanour made her highly popular among friends and neighbours.</p>

                <p>Tu Phuc and Mac Ky were in love for 5 years, despite the fact that it was arranged by Ninh Tu Phuc's parents. He fell in love with Mac Ky at first sight, but Tu Phuc had no idea her twin sister was Mac Le.</p>
                <p> When the bridegroom and the newlyweds execute the ceremony of honouring the body on the wedding day of the two, Tu Phuc appears to be hallucinating just after the second bow. He suddenly notices that the altar he is standing in has changed into a funeral.</p>
                <p> He instantly turned to look at his wife and noticed an unbelievable change—her clothing changed from scarlet to white like a mourning shirt before dissipating into thin air. The vision became suddenly much more horrifying. </p>
                <p> He pinched himself to see if it was a hallucination because he still couldn't believe what he was seeing, but it wasn't—everything in front of him is genuine. Tu Phuc hurried to locate Mac Ky at this point, hoping to find her unharmed.</p>

                <p>Tu Phuc noticed Mac Ky in a white suit after figuring out problems to escape the aisle, but instead of approaching him, she fled to her room and demanded a bracelet.</p>
                <p> Tu Phuc keeps searching for the bracelet for her. However, as he gave the bracelet to Mac Ky, something unexpected occurred. Suddenly, there were two Mac Kys in the room, one wearing white and the other red. As a result, Ninh Tu Phuc is unable to tell which of the two is the one he loves. </p>
                <p> The red-robed bride warned Tu Phuc that the white-dressed bride was not her - Mac Ky: “Tu Phuc, you should stay away from her”, and as soon as Tu Phuc heard that sentence, he turned to look at Mac Ky in white, but she was no longer standing there. He panicked and alerted the bride in his red dress as soon as he turned to look at the red-dressed woman and noticed Mac Ky in the white dress standing behind him. The white shadow took his wife, but not in time. From there, he started searching for his wife and also learned some unexpected facts: his wife also has a twin sister, whose older sister is Mac Le and whose younger sister is his bride Mac Ky.</p>
                <p> Tu Phuc starts to learn the details of the tales told between Mac Le and Mac Ky, as well as the location of the girl's family's village. In order to find her, he did as Mac Le had instructed and travelled to his new home in the city. </p>

                <p>Ninh Tu Phuc did not escape supernatural events after arriving in the city and entering the apartment building where two people live, but fortunately, he was identified and conveniently relocated to the house with Mac Ky by a strange Taoist.</p>
                <p> After telling her entire story in Trang Linh village - where the wedding ceremony took place with Mac Ky - Mac Ky also told Tu Phuc that she was reminded by a Taoist priest just like him, but she didn't believe what the Taoist said, which is why Tu Phuc had difficulties. If she believed Taoist teachings, she would not have asked him to accompany her to the wedding preparations.</p>
                <p> Recognizing that Taoist man, Tu Phuc also extended an invitation to visit his home and made an effort to return Mac Le, his sister's soul, to the underworld. He claimed that in the past, the sister had been left at Thanh Hoang Temple waiting to be sent to the afterlife due to the custom of worshipping Luc Tang Bodhisattva in the village of Trang Linh, but oddly, the sister's soul had not been taken; as a result, the sister has returned to haunt Mac Ky and even cause harm to her. The Taoist guy then dispatched Ninh Tu Phuc to Thanh Hoang Temple with a piece of paper that was folded into the shape of a doll and contained Mac Le's name. </p>

                <p>At Thanh Hoang Temple, Ninh Tu Phuc arrived and started getting ready for worshipping rituals in order to resurrect his sister-in-law Mac Le's spirit from the dead. Yet while executing the ceremony, he was constantly bothered by ghosts who interfered with him. After returning the talisman twice, he is now able to perform the ceremony. Nonetheless, the ordeal is not yet complete because the piece of paper on which he was going to write the accusation is covered with so many "grievances" words that it has turned red and prevented him from writing anything. </p>
                <p> When he turned to look at the talisman he had brought to be sacrificed, he was startled and a little frightened to see his wife's name there. When Tu Phuc questioned "what is happening, how can this be," two ghosts materialised and stole the items from the table. Tu Phuc was aware that it was Mac Ky's parent, but he was unable to comprehend their actions or their intentions.</p>
                <p>He searched for them for a while before locating one white and one red shadow puppet. Ninh Tu Phuc was able to learn the real story behind everything thanks to two shadow puppets.</p>

                <p>His wife, Mac Ky, is not the one he loves at home; rather, it is his sister, Nie Mac Le. What's more tragic is that by listening to Mac Le and the old Taoist, he nearly caused his wife to lose her soul.</p>
                <p> Thanks to the old woman who had reared Mac Le after she had been abandoned at Thanh Hoang Temple, Tu Phuc instantly went back to the Taoist guy after knowing the heartbreaking reality in order to locate Mac Ky.</p>
                <p> When he arrived at the old Taoist, he made an effort to locate Mac Ky before midnight. In addition to facing the difficulties of trying to locate his wife in a dangerous location, Mac Ky also shielded Tu Phuc from nearby demons so that he could locate her body and return her to the mortal world without danger. </p>
                <p> Nie Mac Le also let out a word to seduce Tu Phuc, but he still didn't change his heart, still trying to find the person he loved deeply. After solving the puzzles and locating his wife, he assisted Mac Ky in re-entering the body and alerted the police to arrest Nie Mac Le and the old Taoist for fraud. Mac Ky and Tu Phuc returned home and continued to live together "till death tears us apart". </p>

        <h3 class="lb_heading">Paper Bride 2: Zangling Village</h3>
        <p class="lb_text"> Midsummer's bride dressed in a gown of paper; <br> Torn from her groom and lost forever. <br> July, fifteen, marry the bride, <br> Relatives and friends cry at the scene <br> Paper for making wedding dresses blowing in the wind <br> When will I see my beloved again? <br>
          <br> In part one, we heard about Zangling Village, a strange land with many outdated customs. Although the story of Nie Mac Ky and Ninh Tu Phuc has a happy ending, with the evil being properly punished, the good people live happily. But Zangling Village still exists a series of mysteries with customs that destroy the happiness of many families. <br>
          <br> Now let us open the curtains of the past in Zangling Village. <br>
          <br> The story in Paper Bride 2 is completely independent from the first part. You will be transformed into the character Dao Mong Yen. She has always had strange, haunting dreams about a young woman in a wedding dress being hung on the altar. It seems that Zangling Village not only has the custom of sacrificing children, but they also have a strange custom of marrying young girls to Luc Tang Bodhisattva as a wife. And even more terrifying when the bride's face in the dream is Dao Mong Yen. A lament filled rhyme resounded, and suddenly Dao Mong Yen was tied in the place of the bride. In front of her were life-like dolls. A man called Dai Vu Hien is at the head wearing a red robe, holding a ringing bronze bell. A wooden doll holding a large knife appeared in front of Mong Yen, and the doll's head fell abruptly — that is when she woke up. <br>
          <br> It was this strange dream that prompted Dao Mong Yen to return to Zangling Village to find the answer to the nightmare that had pursued her for the past five months. What does the dream signify? Is this her past life story? How will Mong Yen solve the original mysteries that surround Zangling Village?
